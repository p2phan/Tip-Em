## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.

## Notes

- Choosing color scheme is a hassle sincethere is no option for viewing hex or RGB value
- Iphone 7 stimulation used old build, which had the bug where inserting a number also inserted a period in front of the value
